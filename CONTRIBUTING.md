# How to Contribute

This is a free and open source project and we welcome contributions.

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).

## Contributor's License Agreements

If you're submitting changes to any Blockchain Commons codebases which run in production (not solely documentation), you'll need to upload a signed Contributor's License Agreement for that repository.

To sign a Contributor License Agreement, fill in the relevant fields (indicated like this in the plaintext: $field). 

Then sign using GPG using the following command gpg --armor --clearsign --output ./CLA-signed/CLA.YOURGITHUBNAME.YOURGPGFINGERPRINT.asc CLA.md.

You can either submit your signed Contributor License Agreement to this repo as a GPG signed Pull Request or email it to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com.
