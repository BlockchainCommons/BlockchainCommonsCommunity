# Open Source Grants and Alternative Funding

Open source projects often rely on volunteer contributions and ad-hoc funding. Many developers volunteer their time to either maintain or contribute to open source projects, and the biggest constraint is time. We at Blockchain Commons, an entirely patron funded organization, and we see it in the broader Bitcoin and blockchain communities.

## List of funding sources

In order to keep track of our own funding outreach, and help other OSS developers target their funding requests, we've put together a list of potential funding sources:

1. **Open Source Capital**: OSS Capital is the world's first and only early-stage COSS (Commercial Open-Source Software) company investor and platform - https://oss.capital/

2. **Open Sats**: Open Sats is building a web donation platform where donors can learn, donate, and contribute to Bitcoin Core and related free and open source projects - https://opensats.org/

3. **No Starch Foundation**: - The No Starch Press Foundation (NSPF) will award up to $100,000 USD in grants of no less than $10,000 each to projects that are designed to grow the worldwide hacker community, and support STE(A)M education initiatives https://nostarchfoundation.org/grant-application/
