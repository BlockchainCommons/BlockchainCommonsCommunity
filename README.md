# Blockchain Commons Community

The purpose of the [Blockchain Commons](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons) is to:
* Support open infrastructure that allows people to interact with each on other on the internet in trustless ways.
* Create applications that both exempify best practices and act as real-life tools
* Nurture new talent through internship programs.
* Allow patrons to support the open source blockchain ecosystem that allowed them to be successful.
* Support blockchain documentation, example code, libraries, tutorials, etc.

Under discussion:
* Legal formation TBD to support organization not requiring an exit, but not necessarily a non-profit.
* Transparency to all stakeholders (patrons, customers, management, membership)
* Participatory and inclusive practices, non-hierarchical and decentralized as possible
* All intellectual output Free and Open Source (FOSS) either patent free or defensive patent licenses.
* "Rough consensus & working code"
* A learning community

## Virtual Internships

We had a successful virtual internship program this summer, and are hoping to repeat it this fall. See https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/issues/17 for more details. The deadline for signups is September 23rd (now extended to September 28th).

If you are interested in supporting a specific blockchain FOSS (free and open-source software) project, feature, or bug bounty, or wish to support the Blockchain Commons or open infrastructure in general, please [become an ongoing sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons) or if you prefer [make a donation to our BTCPay](https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/). We are investigating non-profit options (such as working with the Human Rights Founding) but we are not a charitable non-profit at this time, so any contributions are not individually tax-deductible; however, any contributions by businesses are tax-deductible as an expense. See https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons for details.

## Learning Resources

- [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line) — The best way to learn to learn deeply about bitcoin is to avoid GUIs (even bitcoin-qt), and instead learn it from the command line.
- [#SmartCustody](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook) — The Use of Advanced Cryptographic Tools to Improve the Care, Maintenance, Control, and Protection of Digital Assets

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian System Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions). For users and developers of the Gordian system, including the Gordian Server, Bitcoin Standup technology, QuickConnect, and the Gordian Wallet. If you want to talk about our linked full-node and wallet technology, suggest new additions to our Bitcoin Standup standards, or discuss the implementation our standalone wallet, the Discussions area of the [main Gordian repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) is the place.

[**Wallet Standard Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about wallet standards, please use the Discussions area of the [Airgapped Signing repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning). This is where you can talk about projects like our [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) and command line tools such as [seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli), both of which are intended to testbed wallet technologies, plus the libraries that we've built to support your own deployment of wallet technology such as [bc-bip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [bc-slip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Shamir Secret Key Recovery](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur), and the [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base). If it's a wallet-focused technology or a more general discussion of wallet standards,discuss it here.

[**Blockchain Commons Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions). For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than the [Gordian System](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions) or the [wallet standards](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions), each of which have their own discussion areas.
