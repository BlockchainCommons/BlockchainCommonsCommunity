# Blockchain Commons Community

The purpose of the [Blockchain Commons](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons) is to:
* Support blockchain [commons](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/11/a-revised-ostroms-design-principles-for-collective-governance-of-the-commons-.html) initiatives such as free and open-source software (FOSS), security & cryptography infrastructure, improvements to digital asset security best practices, and applied blockchain research to benefit the larger ecosystem.
* Allow patrons to be able to contribute back to support the open source blockchain ecosystem that allowed them to be successful.
* Support senior software engineers & technology companies to participate in the commons by sharing knowledge and best practices of security engineering & architecture.
* Incentivize junior software engineers or those new to blockchain development to learn the best practices of the community, and allow more experienced engineers a place to mentor them.
* Support blockchain documentation, example code, libraries, tutorials, etc.

Under discussion:
* Legal formation TBD to support organization not requiring an exit, but not necessarily a non-profit.
* Transparency to all stakeholders (patrons, customers, management, membership)
* Participatory and inclusive practices, non-hierarchical and decentralized as possible
* All intellectual output Free and Open Source (FOSS) either patent free or defensive patent licenses.
* "Rough consensus & working code"
* A learning community

## News

* 2018-05: We have received initial funds to fund the legal formation of a #BlockchainCommons organization and initial projects, including US\$20K from Adamant Capital & US\$50K from Tierion.

## Projects

* Projects under consideration:
  * P & Q Bulletproofs Reference Implementation
  * Sidechain Security & Architecture Review

If you are interested in supporting a specific blockchain FOSS project, feature or bug bounty, or wish to support the blockchain commons or infrastructure in general, contact [ChristopherA@LifeWithAlacrity.com](mailto:ChristopherA@LifeWithAlacrity.com) — we are investigating non-profit options (such as working with the Software Freedom Conservancy) but we do not have it at this time, so any contributions are not individually tax-deductible, however, any contributions by businesses are tax-deductible as an expense.

## Learning Resources

- [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line) — The best way to learn to learn deeply about bitcoin is to avoid GUIs (even bitcoin-qt), and instead learn it from the command line.

## Community RoadMap

- [x] Create Github Community
  - [ ] Review content with members & patrons
- [x] We need a CONTRIBUTING.md, something along the lines of [ParticipatoryOrgs-Community/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ParticipatoryOrgs/ParticipatoryOrgs-Community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) & [ipfs/contributing.md](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/contributing.md)
  - [ ] Review content with members & patrons
  - [ ] We need a Contributors Agreement (pending legal formation)
- [ ] Create website for blockchaincommons.com, maybe blockchaincommons.org (ChristopherA currently holds these domains)
- [ ] Legal formation
  - [ ] Investigate legal formation options (LLC, L4C, etc.) and legal venues (US, Deleware, Wyoming, overseas,etc.)
  - [ ] Investigate a formal relationship with [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) for those US patrons who wish to contribute tax-deductible funds.
- [ ] Funding
  - [ ] Submit proposals to various foundations desiring to support commons activities
