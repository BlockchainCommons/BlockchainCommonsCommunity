   * This will be going live open "beta" test on mainnet soon.
   * Multisig only.
   * Mainnet means real money can be lost. This technically really a "late alpha" and very risky to use (Apple calls it Beta though). BE CAREFUL.
   * Goal is to focus on being "second signer", or an additional signer/last signer in multisig.
   * It can't create initiate bitcoin transactions for PSBTs, they must be created elsewhere and imported, for instance from one our wallet partners.
   * It can create simple multisig accounts, but normally you import them from elsewhere. Creation may be pulled from release version of Gordian Cosigner as account creation features will be done elsewhere.
   * It can create seeds and derive "signers" keys, or import them. You may also delete these and restore them to sign a specific PSBT on-demand.
