#### First Principles, Principles, Axiom, Patterns,  Models, Processes, Tools

##### First Principles

###### Definition

- A **first principle** is a basic, foundational, self-evident proposition or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption.

##### Principles

###### Definition

- **A principle** is a fundamental assumption while **axiom** is a seemingly which cannot actually be proved or disproved.

##### Axioms

###### Definition

- An **axiom** is a complete, formal statement (ideally one which can be true in some "interesting" models and false in others). A **principle** is a much more general thing, and in fact sometimes "principle" is used to refer to informal heuristics rather than formal properties.

#### Anonymity

##### Burner Laptop

- Choosing
  - I in particular like the MacBook Air 11" ( Mid 2011, A1370, MD214LL/A, Mac 3,1) max 4GB RAM, SSD is upgradeable to 1TB, wifi can be removed for Air Gap machines, has Thunderbolt 1 (though otherwise only two USB 2.0 ports), it will run High Sierra (not Mojave), Tails OS, any Debian-derived OS (if you add Broadcom drivers to installer or remove wifi chip during install), Whonix in VirtualBox in High Sierra, and is even qualified for full Qubes support (but like Debian you have to remove Broadcom WiFi during install). Small, cheap and powerful enough. Get one on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Macbook+Air+A1370) with 4GB RAM as that can't be upgraded, but don't pay a lot for 256GB SSD (the largest Apple offered) as you can upgrade that with OWL.  Many used units will have poor battery quality, so watch for that or be prepared to purchase a battery replacement.

##### Before you Start

##### Basic Tails OS

- Booting basic Tails OS from USB drive
- Using basic Tails OS
- Using Tor Browser
- Other Tails OS Apps
- Bitcoin on Tails - Electrum
- Create new Tails drives

##### Advanced Tails OS

- Persistent Volumes
- Opening Persistent Volumes on Mac
- Customizing Tails
  - [Bash Dotfiles for Tails](https://github.com/ChristopherA/bash-dotfiles-for-tails)

##### Other Anonymous OS

- [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/)
  - Uses host operating system and two VirtualBox VMs
- [Qubes](https://www.qubes-os.org/)
  - Hardware level privacy, but limited drivers

#### SocioSocratic Learning Seminars

- Christopher Has domain SociosocraticLearning.com "Adding the Social Web to the ancient art of Socratic Learning"

- Pedagogy using Zoom https://www.slideshare.net/ChristopherA/my-hybrid-flipped-learning-environment

- Unpublished call-for-students circa 2014 when I left BGI:

  - I have taught technology leadership in a progressive MBA in Sustainable Systems program (Pinchot.edu), yet even given their innovative curriculum, there are number of masters level topics that I would like to teach that are too new or advanced to offer through formal academia. Many of these topics are related to sources of disruption that are driving business change today (Occupy, self-management, blockchains, millenials, breaking out of the "growth" style of entrepreneurship, participatory management, etc.).

    I'm considering offering a sociosocratic style classes online on these management topics, at mastery level, in my Zoom conference room. (Sociosocratic is the ancient Socratic method except that the smart questions & answers come from both students and teacher/facilitator as co-creators.)

    I'm thinking Tuesday's at 5pm PT, probably starting in late fall. Likely it very inexpensive at first ($75 per 3 classes in a single series, more just to hold space and people to firm up their commitments.)

    These are some of the topics that I think the students that are wish to break out of the current approaches to business would find useful. Each of these topics are not complete enough to be a course in and of themselves, but collectively someday could be integrated into one.

    * Stability, Growth, Hypergrowth — the nature of growth, stable businesses, 'big enough", the classic growth economic model, and hyper growth of a 13-person billion dollar business in less then a year (Instagram to Facebook), and breaking out of the growth model.

    * The nature of different entrepreneurial cultures, including family businesses, partnerships, professional partnerships, dividend corps, growth corps, as well as some non-US models like Japan's Keiretsu, Spain's Mondragon, and Italy's Emilia Romagna.

    * Emerging trends in capitalization, including new kinds of debt financing, Kickstarter, angel investing, benefit investing, small business financing, worker cooperatives, and nature of control vs ownership (i.e. zuckerberg style of leveraged control vs. even equally distributed ownership).

    * Alternatives to exits — ESOP, dividends, interest, residuals/royalties, revenue streams

    * Emerging trends in management — lean startups, distributed startups, etc.

    * How to be a founder — founder's dilemma hands-off management, do founders hiring management/operations rather then be management, etc.

    * Stakeholder management — different approaches to ownership and control by employees, sweat-equity, small-business intrapreneurial models, transition / retirement / departure of founders, board members, and key employees, etc.

    * Alternative economic systems — open source, gift economies, sharing economies, participatory ecosystems, etc.

    * Professional consulting & Solopreneurship — the wide variety of small companies with big impact providing design and other services, and not just to large corps.

    * Global entrepreneuring — partnering with entrepreneurs in other countries and cultures.

    * Co-opetition — working with your competitors, growing a market, creating common standards, sharing non-competive advantage functionality (i.e. open source and IBM0, negotiating win-win scenarios.

    * Serial & Parallel entrepreneurship — issues of managing multiple businesses (either in serial or in parallel), surviving the sale of the company, exit strategies, "non-exit" exit strategies.

    * Failure — freedom to fail, "don't let your dogs become your pets", when to cut the cord, when to double-down, failing gracefully, risk management, hibernation, bankruptcy is not the end of the world, learning from failure, postmortems, keeping positive relationships with fired employees.

    * Unique team challenges — early departure of team members, team members with inter-personal relationships, team selection types, virtual/distributed/remote/multi-cultural teams, outsourcing.

    * Mentorship — nature of mentors, coaches, sponsors, advisors, board members, working in industry before building a company, corporate sponsorship (extra-preneurship)

    * Right Livelihood — work-life balance, working from home, co-working, 80% plans (one of: 1 day off a week, leave early or arrive late daily, 1 month sabbatical each year beyond vacation), employee policies and benefits, employee retention, day jobs, incorporating family, women as entrepreneurs and employees, etc.

    * Stories – entrepreneurs, angels, vc's, telling stories of experience with the above.

    With some thinking I would add quite a few more topics, for instance what is going on with blockchain and cryptographic ledgers, decentralized autonomous organization, smart contracts, censorship- & power-resistant systems, incentives, neurology of decision making, austrian economics, etc.

    For an example of a more intensive 12 week hybrid (both F2F & online) course I ran in 2012, [here is my syllabus for Using the Social Web for Social Change](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2012/10/using-the-social-web-for-social-change-syllabus-sw4sx.html)

    [Here is an example of the first two weeks of that more intensive course.](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2012/10/introduction-to-the-social-web-reading-list-sw4sx.html)

    Some of these digital influence topics from this class are additional possible topics students could select from.

    I think the format for class would be pick a topic & three Tuesday's that work for about 7 students. Week 1 would start with Scan — I would provide a list of read ahead articles & videos, and discussion asynchronous and in online chat room would be about them. Week 2 would be Focus — picking a sub-topic to dive deeper into, with some assignments for all to do some research. Week 3 would be Synthesis — collaboratively write up best synthesis and links about topic, with the audience being the next time class might be run on same topic or for use by professional practitioners. Commitment: 4-1/2 hours in synchronous class (1-1/2 per meeting), about 3 hours of reading and research and 2 hours writing.
