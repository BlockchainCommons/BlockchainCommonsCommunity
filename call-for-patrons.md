In the last few years you have gotten to know me through my work, either as an decentralized identity advocate or as a blockchain architect either at Blockstream, in a internest standards community, as a speaker at a blockchain conference, or through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChristopherA).

I founded [Blockchain Commons](https://www.BlockchainCommons.com) a bit over two years ago. Along with others experts from both the blockchain and decentralized identity communities we've done important work on topics such as [#SmartCustody](https://www.SmartCustody.com) including a free book on [care of digital assets](http://bit.ly/SmartCustodyBookV101), produced online courses such as [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line), released bitcoin full-node tools such as [Bitcoin Standup](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup), produced mobile apps such as [Fully Noded 2](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/FullyNoded-2), and even created DIY security hardware kits such as the [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit). Our goal is to improve the infrastructure and knowledge base for blockchain technology, to benefit everyone.

We proudly a "not-for-profit" social benefit corporation committed to open source & open development. Our work has been financially supported solely by our patrons and individual contributors, including Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Gabriele Domenechini, Frederic Meyer, David Strayhorn, Mark S. Miller, Sean Moss-Pulz, Glenn Willen, Alexandre Linhares, and Trent McConaghy, as well as many small anonymous sponsors. Last year's #SmartCustody book was further supported by corporate patrons including Bitmark, Digital Contract Design, HTC Exodus, Adamant Capital, Beam Privacy, Catallaxy, Ledger, Unchained Capital, Winstead, Blockstream, Empowered Law, and Cryptotag.

I'm hoping that you can join us, to support this infrastructural work, and to spread the word to others who might also help.

So please consider becoming a Patron of Blockchain Commons by contributing Bitcoin at our BTCPay Server or becoming a Github Sponsor through ongoing fiat patronage.

I'm also kicking off my personal campaign to solicit support for my human rights privacy & decentralized identity advocacy and related efforts. I am seeking sponsorship for that starting at $5 a month through GitHub Sponsors â€” and they are matching the first $5K!

Your becoming a GitHub sponsor at any level can be particularly valuable because it creates social proof that can encourage other people, companies, and foundations to match! So please show your "badge" of honor by sponsoring Blockchain Commons at https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons or me personally at https://github.com/sponsors/ChristopherA

Separately for blockchain business and service providers, if you donate 1 BTC, or sign up as Sustaining Patron at GitHub ($1000/mo), we will accept a one-page non-bleed informative flier about your business or services for inclusion in the next edition of our #SmartCustody book. Your firm will be listed as a sponsor and, where appropriate, we will list your product or service as an option. (But even if you're not a business, or you want to sponsor us with a smaller amount, we encourage you to do so!)

I also tremendously appreciate personal endorsements on Twitter (such as this one from [Mark Miller](https://twitter.com/marksammiller/status/1246528666151948288?s=21)), [JW Weatherman](https://twitter.com/jwweatherman_/status/1246535216581300225?s=21)[@Frogolocolypse](https://twitter.com/1stcrasscitizen/status/1246801134490025985?s=21), [Leon-Gerard Vandenberg](https://twitter.com/leon_vandenberg/status/1246540433695653888?s=21), on [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophera/), or other social meida ointing to my GitHub sponsor pages, and otherwise help to spread the word about our good work.
