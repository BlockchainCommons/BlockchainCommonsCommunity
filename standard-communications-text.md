### Personal Sponsorship Appeal
(From @ChristopherA via Twitter DM or email)

Can I get your PERSONAL monthly patronage to support my work at @BlockchainComns through a GitHub sponsorship of $20 or $100 a month?

Blockchain Commons is proudly a "not-for-profit" social benefit corporation committed to open source & open development. Our work is funded entirely by donations and collaborative partnerships with people like you. Every contribution will be spent on building open tools, technologies, and techniques that sustain and advance blockchain and internet security infrastructure and promote an open web.

Here are some of our current projects:

* #SmartCustody — documents and tools to better secure your digital assets.
* #BitcoinStandup — tools and standards for easy creation of your own Bitcoin-Core full node on your Mac or Linux or on a cloud VPS.
* #FullyNoded2 — an iOS multisig wallet powered by a Tor V3 hidden service and connected to your own personal full node.
* #LetheKit — DIY hardware box and SDK for airgapped cryptography and offline master key management.
* Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line — tutorials on programming with bitcoin-cli, lightning-cli, and RPC.
* Cryptographic Libraries — C-based implementations of BIP39, Shamir Secret Sharing, SLIP39, and more.

We also offer services to improve the open web's security infrastructure:

* Security Reviews — risk-based assessments of custody methodologies, operational security procedures, and layer-2 protocols such as payment channels.
* Infrastructure — support of Tor exit nodes and other blockchain infrastructure & tools.
* Project Support — contractual support of our projects such as #BitcoinStandup, #FullyNoded2, and #LetheKit.

These are just the beginning! Blockchain Commons is also working on identity wallets, zero-knowledge curve-operation proofs, advanced cryptographic primitives such as Schnorr, MuSig, and scriptless scripts, and in general establishing multi- and cross-blockchain standards.

By supporting Blockchain Commons, you are also supporting my personal advocacy with legislators & regulators in Wyoming, the Netherlands, and Taiwan for better digital-asset custody regulations & privacy laws, as well as my efforts to advance human-rights privacy & decentralized identity in standards groups such as #W3C.

I really need your public support on our GitHub Sponsors page. GitHub is matching the first $5,000 and YOUR public endorsement will help in my fundraising discussions with foundations and other organizations.

Key blockchain figures like Andreas M. Antonopoulos (@aantonop), Bitcoin Core contributors like Bryan Bishop (@kanzure), Glenn Willem (@gwillen), and Mark Friedenbach (@MarkFriedenbach), internet security luminaries like Mark Miller (@erights), and blockchain companies like @Avanti & @Bitmark have already signed up as sponsors and public supporters. I would like to see your name added to that page.

Can I count on YOUR patronage? Join me on the Blockchain Commons GitHub Sponsors page:

Can I count on YOUR personal endorsement of my work? Like this tweet by Mark Miller (@erights) pointing to my Sponsors page: https://twitter.com/marksammiller/status/1246528666151948288?s=21

Thank you!
